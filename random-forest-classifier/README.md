## Dataset

[Heart Failure Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)

This dataset contains 918 patient records, each with 11 clinical features that are commonly used in cardiovascular diagnostics.
The goal is to predict whether a patient is likely to develop heart disease based on medical measurements, lifestyle indicators, and symptoms.
